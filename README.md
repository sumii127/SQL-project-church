* Server: Apache
* Interface for MySQL: phpMyAdmin
## Tasks that must be completed
For this project, there are 8 tasks one must complete to finish the project succesfully. Those 8 tasks being:
* 1. Create ER Diagram
  2. Relational database schema and database constraints
  3. Implementing the database
  4. Input data for at least 5 congregations
  5. Implement SQL modifications
  6. Implement at least three indexes
  7. Design a User Interface
  8. Implement two specific SQL views
 ## Phase 1: Submission of 11/10/23
 In this first phase what will be submitted is:
 * A report which includes:
   * An ER diagram which provides a visual representation of entities, attributes and the relationships.
   * A database schema which is a diagram s=showing the tables, fields, data types, primary keys, and the foreign keys.
   * A database constraints list and its explanation of its use.
* A .zip file which will include:
   * SQL files of the created tables and constraints. (includes the DDL commands)
   * A README.md file which details what will be in the submission.
## Phase 2: FINAL Submission of 12/4/23
  In this final phase of the project, what will be submitted is:
  * A report which includes:
    1. An executive Summary
    2. An introduction
    3. The projects specifications
    4. The database design which includes:
       * ER diagram
       * Database schema
       * Entities and attributes
       * Relations
       * And constraints
    5.Implementation details which includes:
       * Relational database schema and constraints
       * Data definition language (DDL)
       * Data manipulation language (DML)
       * SQL modifications and indexes
    6. User interface design
    7. SQL views and operations which includes:
       * 2 CREATE VIEW implementations
       * 10 implemented SQL queries
    8. Technologies used
    9. Challenges and solutions
    10. User guide and installation
    11. Conclusions
    12. Appendices
  * A zip file which includes:
    1. code of conduct for all 3 teammates
    2. The README.md file
    3. PHP pages
    4. HTML pages
    5. SQL files
## A step by step on how to run this final phase on ones own PC
  * step 1. the user will open their MySQL workbench and create a new schema and run the file 
    church_project_by_alicia_suamy_maden.sql to create the tables and the SQL operations.
  * step 2. you will run the db_church_script.sql to populate the tables with the sample data.
  * step 3. once all of the sql files are running and saved, you will create a new folder in 
    your C drive under the xampp\htdocs and copy the websitee.zip and extract it inside the 
    folder.
  * step 4. open the xampp control panel and run PHP and SQL
  * step 5. open your web browser and go to http://localhost/index3.php and from there you can 
    access the website and its features.
  * step 6. you are done!
